# Shuttle Bus Survey

The research question driving this study was: What specific information do shuttle bus passengers need, and how do they prefer to access this information during their journey? This study seeks to establish the formats of information that are of the most value to passengers, both marketable but common information (e.g., route descriptions and shuttle bus schedules) and less marketable but rather uncommon information (e.g., departure countdowns and accessibility-friendly routes). We are studying user preferences for this type of information representation and whether these views are presented on mobile devices, private screens, or public displays. We also provide functionalities such as Near Field Communication (NFC) to board and viewing assistance to allow passengers to position themselves exactly where the bus is going to come, which is beneficial in unfamiliar environments. This will allow evaluation of the passenger's efficiency, convenience and satisfaction related to using these features, leading to a set of actionable insights to be considered in designing user-centric transportation interfaces. This research specifically applies to automated shuttles, given that the study is prompted by the special needs and inclinations related to automated shuttle use.

## Getting Started
Tested with Python 3.9.19. To setup the environment run these two commands in a parent folder of the downloaded repository (replace `/` with `\` and possibly add `--user` if on Windows:

**Step 1:**  

Clone the repository
```command line
git clone https://github.com/Shaadalam9/shuttle-boarding.git
```

**Step 2:** 

Create a new virtual environment
```command line
python -m venv venv
```

**Step 3:** 

Activate the virtual environment
```command line
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows use
```command line
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Step 4:** 

Install dependencies
```command line
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

**Data preparation**

Response data from the participants is available at [4TU Research Data](http://doi.org/10.4121/76432912-37c4-4603-97e7-9cabbaba653e).

### Filtering of response
Data from the response is filtered based on the following criteria:
1. People who did not read instructions.
2. People who did not give consent.

### Configuration of project
Configuration of the project needs to be defined in `shuttle-boarding/config`. Please use the `default.config` file for the required structure of the file. If no custom config file is provided, `default.config` is used. The config file has the following parameters:
* `data`: location of the response file.
* `plots`: location for the saving the figures.
* `plotly_template`: template used to make graphs in the analysis.

### Viewing Assistance
Viewing assistance is a feature designed to help passengers navigate and position themselves accurately at shuttle bus stops. This tool assists users in determining the exact location where they should stand to board the shuttle bus, particularly in unfamiliar environments. By utilizing real-time guidance through mobile devices, viewing assistance can overcome navigation challenges and language barriers, ensuring a smooth and efficient boarding process.
